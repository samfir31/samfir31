    ### Hi, i'm Samuel.
  </h2>
  <p>
- I'm passionate about technology and making a difference in the places where I work. I am an objective person who loves to discuss ideas, learn new things and reflect on lived moments. :smiley:<br>
- :game_die: I love playing strategy games with my friends and my favorite is War. In this game you need to learn how to collect resources and use tools to achieve an objective. I believe that within the various challenges of an engineer, knowing how to see and use them as opportunities is essential. I always do a little dance when a code works because it gives me immense happiness. :video_game: <br>
- Software engineer at Ita√∫ Unibanco. <br>
- Student of postgraduate in Software engineering at Puc. <br>
- Graduate in System Analysis and Development at Unicid. <br>
- My personal foundation is my family where I find a safe environment to share my emotions. I believe that being an engineer is more than creating solutions, it's transforming the way we live. <br><br>
- Feel free to call me and talk about career, systems development and technology.<br>
